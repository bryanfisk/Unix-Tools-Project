Term project for Unix Tools (CSCI 5930) at Saint Louis University during the Spring 2019 semester.

This script randomly picks a Wikipedia article and then follows the first link (after some filtering) in the main body of the article. The script stops traversing through Wikipedia articles once it reaches the philosophy Wikipedia article.

Default output is to stdout but can be redirected to a file output. Also includes Python script to create a Graphviz visualization and give simple statistics after running the Bash script multiple times.
